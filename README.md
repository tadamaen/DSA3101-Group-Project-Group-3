## Enhancing Guest Experience Through Data-Driven Journey Mapping and Analysis 

#### Introduction 

This project aims to analyze guest experiences at Universal Studios Singapore (USS), addressing growing concerns about increasing dissatisfaction rates among visitors. Despite efforts to enhance guest satisfaction, USS has struggled to pinpoint the key factors driving this decline, making it difficult to implement targeted improvements.

By leveraging a data-driven approach, predictive modeling and agent-based simulations, this project seeks to optimize guest flow and enhance the overall visitor experience. Poor satisfaction ratings can lead to declining attendance, reduced revenue, and ultimately lower profitability for USS. By identifying and addressing pain points, the project aims to boost operational efficiency, improve guest satisfaction and drive revenue growth, ensuring USS remains a top entertainment destination.

#### How the project came about? (Problems faced by entertainment venues)

The project was initiated in response to growing challenges faced by Universal Studios Singapore (USS) in maintaining high guest satisfaction amidst evolving visitor expectations. In recent years, demographic shifts have led to a more diverse audience with varied preferences and demands, making it increasingly difficult to cater to all guest segments effectively. Additionally, guest dissatisfaction rates have been rising, with common complaints related to long wait times, overcrowding, inefficient park layouts and inconsistent service quality.

Despite USS's efforts to enhance operations, they have struggled to pinpoint the exact causes behind this growing dissatisfaction. This issue is critical because poor guest experiences can lead to negative reviews, reduced visitor retention, lower attendance, and ultimately a decline in revenue and profitability. Furthermore, the increased reliance on digital experiences and higher expectations for seamless, personalized services put additional pressure on theme parks to modernize their approach. Recognizing these challenges, this project was developed to leverage data-driven insights, predictive modeling and agent-based simulations to identify inefficiencies, optimize guest flow and enhance overall satisfaction, ultimately improving USS’s long-term operational success.

#### What are the motivations of the project?

The motivation behind this project stems from USS’s need to accurately identify and address the root causes of increasing customer dissatisfaction. Despite ongoing efforts to enhance visitor experiences, USS has struggled to pinpoint specific pain points that contribute to negative reviews, reduced visitor retention and declining profitability. By leveraging data-driven insights, the project aims to analyze satisfaction trends, identify key drivers of dissatisfaction and develop targeted solutions to improve overall guest experiences. 

Another crucial motivation is to better understand changing visitor demographics and their evolving expectations. With shifting consumer behaviors and preferences, USS must be able to segment guests based on their interests, behaviors and visit patterns, allowing for a more personalized and efficient approach to park management. Through advanced analytics and predictive modeling, this project seeks to identify market trends and develop strategic initiatives tailored to different customer segments. By optimizing guest flow, enhancing operational efficiency and designing customized experiences for various demographics, the project ultimately aims to boost visitor satisfaction, increase attendance and maximize revenue for USS in an increasingly competitive entertainment industry.

#### What problems the project hopes to solve?
The project hopes to dive into identifying various aspects affecting guest experiences in the USS, both positively and negatively. Understanding the variety of factors, more importantly, the weight of each of these factors, could help us unravel what are the considerations to be made when boosting guest journey in USS.

#### Benefits of the project 

#### Limitations of the project
For the optimization model, the results were significant in demonstrating the impact on ride attractions, however, there are limited information to how the changes made an impact to the eateries and souvenir shops. This is mainly due to the lack of comprehensive information that could possibly account for the crowd present at these places, causing the model to be limited in reflecting accurate wait times (wait time results showed little to zero wait times for these places) for these places.
